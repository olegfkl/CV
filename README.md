I'm a junior full stack web developer, passionate fan of writing clean and test driven code. I'm in constant need of intellectual challenges, progression and logical thinking. Having an IT background working with networking technologies, I utilised my previously gained technical knowledge and problem solving skills to supplement my
advancement in web development. With my passion for technologies I'm extremely enthusiastic to see my projects come to life.

Completing Makers Academy has been a great experience which has turned me into a competent and confident junior developer. I am keen to join and add value to a company where I can be constantly challenged while working with cutting edge technologies.
